Can We Customize Feign Client Behavior?
Yes, we can customize the behavior of the Feign Client with the help of additional configurations.

Adding Request Interceptors: We can add request interceptors to modify or log requests before they are sent.

Implementing Error Handling: Feign Client allows us to define custom error handling mechanisms, such as handling specific HTTP error codes or exceptions.

Configuring Retry Logic: We can configure Feign Client to automatically retry failed requests with configurable retry policies.

Enabling Compression: Feign Client supports the request and response compression, which can be enabled to reduce network bandwidth usage.
